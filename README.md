# Predictive modeling for credit card offer acceptance

In this project we build a machine learning solution for analyzing customer behavior for credit card offer acceptance.

# The Problem

This initiative is undertaken to delve into the trends in customer acceptance of credit card offers from financial institutions.
Our aim is to enhance our comprehension of the factors influencing offer acceptances and to develop predictive insights into whether a customer is more inclined to accept or decline the offer.
